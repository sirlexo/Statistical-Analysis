üìä AI vs Human Expert Classification Analysis
Welcome to the AI vs Human Expert Classification Analysis repository! This project explores the classification accuracy of an AI system compared to human experts across various batches of classification problems. The analysis considers multiple factors, including task complexity, AI explanation settings, and classification type, to evaluate performance trends and insights.

üîç About the Project
This project focuses on comparing the classification accuracy of an AI system against human experts (HE) across different problem batches. Each batch consists of classification tasks defined by:

Batch ID ‚Äì A label identifying a specific batch of classification problems.
AI Accuracy (%) ‚Äì The average classification accuracy of the AI system for the batch.
HE Accuracy (%) ‚Äì The average classification accuracy of human experts for the batch.
Complexity ‚Äì Categorized as Simple, Moderate, or Difficult, indicating the complexity level of the classification tasks.
Explain Mode ‚Äì AI system running with explanations On or Off to determine the impact of explanation processing.
Type ‚Äì Whether the classification problems are designed to detect Positive or Negative outcomes.
By analyzing these factors, this project aims to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of AI-driven classification compared to human performance.
